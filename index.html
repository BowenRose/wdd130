      <p>Hello My name is Bowen Rose ad I am from Idaho Falls, Idaho.I enjoy I am passioate about hiking, photography, and trying out new recipes. I love exploring the outdoors, capturing moments with my camera, and experimenting in the kitchen. When I’m not outside or cooking, you’ll probably find me reading a good mystery novel or watching documentaries. I’m always up for a great conversation and enjoy connecting with people who are curious and open-minded. Looking forward to getting to know you!" ... </p>

         <p>idaho is one of the state on the map that is shaped kinda like a right triangle drawn by a toddler. my favorite thing about idaho is the outdoors namely the mountains and lakes. i have lived in idaho for all eighteen years of my life and I can testify that it is as good a place as any to spend your youth. I live in a city called Ammon, Idaho that is pretty small but not potato fields and hay small</p>
